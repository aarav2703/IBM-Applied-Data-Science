# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction Project



This project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage using machine learning techniques. It involves data collection from the SpaceX API and web scraping from Wikipedia, exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive data visualizations, and building predictive models.

## Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized space launches with the Falcon 9, significantly reducing costs by reusing the first stage. This project aims to predict whether the first stage will successfully land, crucial for estimating launch costs and competitiveness in the commercial space industry.

## Features

- Data collection from SpaceX API and web scraping of launch data from Wikipedia.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL and visualizations to understand launch patterns, success rates, and influencing factors.
- Interactive visual analytics with Folium maps for geospatial insights and Plotly Dash for dynamic dashboards.
- Predictive modeling using classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors) to predict landing outcomes.
- GitHub repository with detailed documentation and notebooks showcasing methodology and results.
